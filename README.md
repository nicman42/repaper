Updates the windows desktop background with the current [muzei](http://www.muzei.co) or [momentum](https://momentumdash.com/) image every day.

The image is optional blured and darkened. Similar to the android muzei app. Double click on the tray icon to show the image unblured for some seconds.

To use the momentum image, you must have installed and use the momentum chrome extension (this app reads the information about the current image from the local storage of the momentum extension).
